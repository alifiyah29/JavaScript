        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> I am a passionate and results-oriented full-stack developer with a strong
            foundation in web development, databases, and
            cloud technologies. I leverage my skills to design, develop, and deploy scalable web applications that cater
            to user
            needs.</p>
        <h2>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <div class="experience">
            <p class="title">LMS Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Indore, MP, India - Oct’21 – Jun’22</p>
            <p>
                Developed Employee Management System Functionalities (JavaScript & MERN Stack): At LMS Solutions, I
                contributed to
                building a custom Employee Management System (EMS) using JavaScript. As the primary front-end language,
                JavaScript
                enabled me to create the user interface and handle functionalities like data entry forms and user
                interactions. I
                focused on implementing core functionalities for managing employee information (adding, viewing,
                updating) for over 500
                users. This experience provided practical knowledge of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
                within a web
                development project.
                Learned and Applied MERN Stack Technologies and CI/CD Integration: Collaborating with senior
                developers, I solidified
                my skills in both front-end (JavaScript) and back-end development (MERN stack: MongoDB, ExpressJS). I
                played a key role
                in building a custom Employee Management System using JavaScript for the user interface and CRUD
                operations.
                Furthermore, I gained experience with MongoDB's scalability for efficient data management and ExpressJS
                for server-side
                logic. This project not only strengthened my full-stack development capabilities but also introduced me
                to CI/CD
                pipelines. By leveraging CI/CD tools, I learned to automate code building, testing, and deployment,
                ensuring a
                streamlined and reliable delivery process for the Employee Management System.
                Enhanced Problem-Solving through Collaboration and API Testing: Working alongside experienced
                developers fostered my
                problem-solving skills and ability to collaborate effectively in a software development environment.
                Furthermore, I
                gained hands-on experience with API testing using Postman. This involved sending test requests that
                simulated user
                interactions with the EMS backend (built with the MERN stack) using Postman. By verifying the responses
                from the
                backend, I contributed to ensuring the system functioned correctly.

            <p class="title">OneHash Technologies Pvt. Ltd, M.P. India Oct’20 – Sep’21</p>
            <p>
                Enhanced Lead Capture and Nurturing with JavaScript & APIs (Front-End Development): Designed and
                developed custom user
                interfaces (UIs) with JavaScript to seamlessly integrate lead generators like Salesforce Leads and
                Mailchimp into
                OneHash's CRM. I leveraged these APIs to understand data structures and establish a smooth flow of lead
                information
                between platforms. This streamlined lead capture for clients, eliminating the need to switch platforms,
                and automated
                data transfer to OneHash's database, improving lead nurturing efficiency.
                Automated Data Transfer with JavaScript: Implemented functionalities within the custom UI to
                automatically transfer
                captured lead data to OneHash's secure database using JavaScript. This involved writing code to handle
                data manipulation
                and API calls to the database. By automating data transfer, I eliminated manual entry for clients and
                improved the lead
                nurturing process. This solidified my front-end development skills, requiring proficiency in data
                handling and API
                interaction.
                Expanded Technical Understanding through API Integration (Lead Gen APIs): Through in-depth work with
                lead generation
                APIs like Salesforce Leads and Mailchimp, I gained valuable experience in understanding data structures
                and
                communication protocols used by external applications. This broadened my technical knowledge beyond UI
                development and
                prepared me for future integrations with various external services.
